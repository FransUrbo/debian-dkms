  * Makefile, debian/rules: Only copy the init script in for redhat targets.
  * kernel_postinst.d: Make sure that dkms_autoinstaller is executable (LP: #480055)

dkms (2.1.1.0-0ubuntu3) lucid; urgency=low

  * dkms_autoinstaller: Copy logic from update-initramfs; when no kernel
    version is given, use the /vmlinuz link maintained by the kernel package
    to select one (or fallback to the current).  This should build modules
    for the right kernel from module package postinst; rebuilding when that
    link is changed is already taken care of by the kernel postinst.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 15 Dec 2009 11:33:15 +0000

dkms (2.1.1.0-0ubuntu2) lucid; urgency=low

  * Remove the init script and Upstart job.
    There is no reason that DKMS needs to run on boot; you can build
    modules for non-running kernels just fine at installation time.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 15 Dec 2009 11:20:37 +0000

dkms (2.1.1.0-0ubuntu1) lucid; urgency=low

  [ Mario Limonciello ]
  * New upstream version
  * dkms_autoinstall: Minor logic cleanups from submitted patches.
  * dkms_autoinstall: Run under dash since dkms.conf isn't sourced anymore.
  * dkms_autoinstall: Whitespace cleanup.
  * Convert DKMS to an upstart script that starts up before GDM or KDM can
    start.  This ensures that drivers are built before X tries to start.
    (LP: #453365)
  * dkms_autoinstall: Rather than having if/else clauses all over the script,
    stub out any functions that aren't provided on Debian/Ubuntu when
    /etc/debian_version isn't present.
  * dkms_autoinstall: Exit immediately if this script is present but DKMS
    isn't anymore rather than sourcing functions and then exiting.
  * kernel_postinst.d_dkms: Launch the upstart script instead. In the process
    all output will be going to /var/log/dkms_autoinstaller (LP: #292606)
  * dkms_autoinstall: Don't ever output to stdout, even with kernel parameters.
  * dkms_autoinstall: Don't log the situation that we already have everything
    installed that needs to be.
  * dkms_autoinstall: Rather than logging to /var/log/dkms_autoinstaller,
    use logger to log to syslog during build and install.
  * dkms_autoinstall: Clean up the method to get arch.  These hacks shouldn't
    be necessary.  If you have problems with them gone, file a bug and we'll
    fix them more cleanly.
  * dkms_autoinstall: Notate the kernel we are building a module against
    when building it.
  * debian/rules: Don't attempt to stop DKMS on upgrades.  It's a task, not
    a daemon, so stop wouldn't do anything.
  * Makefile: Install the old initscript to /usr/lib so that different distros
    can migrate to upstart at their leisure.
  * Makefile: Move any debian specific calls into the Makefile.
  * dkms: Revert the code that runs DKMS as the user "nobody".  
    - It's causing problems with people with nonstandard PAM configs because it
      uses "su". (LP: #484725)
    - Also people have reported that nothing should be owned by 'nobody' per
      Debian & Ubuntu policy.  This could have been fixed by creating a DKMS
      user, but that still wouldn't solve the problems with using 'su'.
  * dkms: Emit built-module MODULE=foo if initctl is available on the system
    after done building a module.   
  * Add a special apport package-hook for when package builds fail to try
    to report them against the package providing that DKMS package.
    (LP: #484871)
  
  [ Alberto Milone ]
  * dkms_common.postinst: try to build the module for the most recent
    kernel in addition to building it for the current kernel (LP: #474917).

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * dkms_autoinstall: optimize with a single find call instead of multiple
    loops with ls. (LP: 3484386)
  * dkms_autoinstall: drop localization of the usage message - this is
    inconsistent with all other init scripts on the system.

  [ Pauli Virtanen ]
  * Remove dependence from environment's umask and certain environment 
    variables. (LP: #438393, #436039)

  [ Giuseppe Iuculano ]
  * dkms_autoinstall: Correct the provides in the LSB block.

  [ David Paleino ]
  * dkms: improve error message, and add Debian/Ubuntu specific suggestion.

    time). Use instead (and create if necessary)
    /etc/modprobe.d/package_name.conf. (Closes: #525379)

  * [1ffb2cd] Removed 03-use-new-header_postinst.d_directory.patch,

    must use /etc/kernel/postinst.d/ directory.
  * [eff2f3e] debian/control: demoted linux-headers and linux-image in
    Recommends, removed kernel-package and build-essential from Depends,
    and added only gcc and make.
